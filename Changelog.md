# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Removed `check_ground` from rover actions — ground is now auto-scanned after every move
- Removed `charge` from rover actions — charging is now station-only via `charge_rover()`
- Mission success now requires delivering target stones to the station, not just collecting them
- Station agent can charge rovers (new `charge_rover` tool) and auto-charges them on arrival
- Mock rover now digs/picks up stones and navigates back to station when carrying target stone
- Updated rover system prompt with auto-charge and return-to-base instructions
- **Coordinate system flipped to math convention**: north = +Y, south = -Y; (0,0) renders at bottom-left of the map
- **Stone types are now hidden**: all stones spawn as `"unknown"` with a hidden `_true_type`; rovers must `analyze` before digging/picking up
- Stone generation uses **preferential attachment clustering** — core stones cluster together instead of uniform random placement

### Added

- **`analyze` action**: reveals a stone's true type (core/basalt), costs 3% battery; dig/pickup now require prior analysis
- **`analyze_ground` action**: reads ground concentration at current tile (0.0–1.0 indicating proximity to core deposits), costs 3% battery; readings stored in agent memory
- **Concentration map**: computed from core positions using Gaussian falloff (`exp(-d²/σ²)`, σ=4.0), serialized in snapshots for UI access
- Dynamic **task priority system** in `update_tasks()`: return-to-station > analyze > dig > pickup > navigate-to-stone > explore
- `_direction_hint()` helper for human-readable navigation hints in agent context
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) with 5 jobs: change detection, server lint (ruff), server test (rut + SurrealDB), UI lint + build (eslint + vite), and Docker build verification
- ESLint 9 flat config for Vue 3 frontend (`ui/eslint.config.js`)
- `unknown` stone color (`#4a4a6a`) in UI constants and AgentDetailModal CSS
- Snapshot filtering: `_true_type` stripped from broadcast to prevent UI leaking hidden info

### Fixed

- `rut` test runner dependency changed from broken local path to git source (`server/pyproject.toml`)
- SurrealDB readiness check in test conftest hardened with retry loop instead of fragile `time.sleep(1)` (`server/tests/conftest.py`)
